# Automate

This is a project I am working on since its interesting, having an app which automates most of the things of your pc. Apart from just automating I also added voice commands from which you can choose what to do when you speak _ and "Auto Apps" which automatically turns off _ processes when your cpu usage is high, quite convenient no?

# The Gui...

Yeah, I know the gui is sorta crappy but I was limited to tkinter in python, and anyone would know that its hard to make modern style good gui's in it, and I am just not the "gui" type of guy

# Auto Exe

It automatically gives you a list of options to choose from when you download a exe in your downloads folder

You could do it all manually but having just a button press to do anything is convenient and fast and quite the point of "Automating"

# Auto Jpg

Similar to Auto Exe, it gives you a list of options to choose from

You might wanna convert a image to jpg if its in some other format, instead of going to a online converted or something, this app does it for you, additionally to have your downloads folder sorted, it sends all images in your download folder to a Images folder in your downloads.

# Auto PDF

This converts a ".ppt" to ".pdf" which just a button click, although it needs powerpoint to be installed, its still quite convenient to have since a ".ppt"( can't be opened by browsers
*(It gives you a option on whether to do or not)*
apart from that it gives you a option to open, move and open, move, delete or do nothing with the ppt/pdf

# Auto Apps

this automatically pauses automate and closes the background apps (which you have to select in the main menu) when you are doing something intensive like playing games. it checks if your cpu and ram usage is high, and pauses and closes apps accordingly

# Voice Commands (This feature requires a internet connection to convert your mic input into text)

First, you get to configure the voice commands in the main menu, you get to choose what should automate hear out for, and if it hears it, what it should do, you can choose between a windows shortcut or a windows terminal command,

After you choose either of them, the gui is pretty simple, you just have to type out what does what and you are good to go!

After you having configured the commands, you can just close the configuration tab and hit save and run, and the app would hear out for the commands!

# Miscellaneous

Auto APK (Only works if you have a APK Installer on your pc) and Auto Torrent and Auto Zips and Auto Jars are just for opening or deleting and sorting the things into a folder assigned to them or additionally you can move them into a folder of your choice.
